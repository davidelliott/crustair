# Soil respiration apparatus

This microcosm system was designed for simple automated replicated soil respiration experiments to help understand the role of microbes in soils. 

This was supported by initially Levehulme Trust grant F/00426/H specifically for studies on carbon flux through biologically crusted Kalahari soils. 

Further development is being supported with Dalton Research Instutute funding (Manchester Metropolitan University) to make the system more generally applicable and extensible.

## Hardware
Design files for hardware components such as the chamber itself.

## Firmware
Firmware for microcontrollers which will control the experiment and log data.

## Software
Software for additional control and logging, via interface with the microcontrollers.
