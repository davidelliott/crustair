## Basic chamber
This is the original design and can be made very simply using pipe and laser-cut acrylic sheet. 

## Chamber
This is an improved design based on our experiences with the basic chamber. This degign is intended for manufacture by 3D printing.

## OpenSCAD notes
If the design does not render when pressing F5, try setting the "Force Goldfeather" option in advanced preferences.
